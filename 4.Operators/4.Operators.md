# Operators

**Python supports the following types of operator:** 

Arithmetic Operators,Assignment Operators,Relational Operators,Boolean & Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, Membership Operators & Identity Operators.
## Arithmetic Operators
| Operators | Description |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
|+|Addition|
|-|Subtraction|
|*|Multiplication|
|/|Division|
|//|Floor Division|
|%|Modulus|
|**|Exponent|

> // Floor Division - Division of Operands where result is quotent in which digits are removed after decimal point.

#### 1. / - Division
   1. / will always give fractional part
   2. if Either Numerator or Denominator are negative then the answer is negative.

#### 2. // - Floor Division 
   1. // will perform floor division
   2. if either Numerator or Denominator are float then .0 would be added to answer.

#### 3. % - Modulus
 1. Result Sign will be the sign of the Denominator
 2. If either Numerator or Denominator are float then .0 would be added to answer.

### Order of Operators:
* When more than one operator appears in expression Python follows **PE MD AS**
* Operator with same precedence are evaluated left to right.(except Exponent operator which is right to left)

## Assignment Opertators
