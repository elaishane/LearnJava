## Python Features: 

* **Simple and Easy:**
    * Programs in Python are written in English like statements which implies more clarity and a compact code.

* **Procedure and Object Oriented:**
    * Python programs can be created using functions and also using classes and objects.

* **Dynamically Typed:**
    * In Python an assignment binds a name to an object meaning no data type to be specified.

* **Interpreted:**
    *  Python code is translated into byte code and then the byte code is interpreted by Python Virtual Machine(VPM).

* **Platform Independent & Portable:**
    * Python`s compiler generated byte codes which can be run on any system having Python Virtual Machine.

* **Huge Library:**
    * Python has huge library for developing programs faster.

### Note:

1. Extension of byte code is **__.pyc__**
2. While saving the program use any extension except **__.pyc__**
    * Advice: Generally use **__.py__**

## Steps for Writing and Executing Python Program:

* __Step1:__ Use any editor like Notepad, Notepad++,IDLE, PyCharm for writing a program
* __Step2:__ Save the program with __.py__ extension.
